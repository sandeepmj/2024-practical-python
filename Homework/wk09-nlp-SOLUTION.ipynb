       "addressing the presence of toxic forever chemicals known as \n",
       "PFAS in our drinking water. This announcement was some 20 years \n",
       "in the making. It is an issue that is very important to, as it \n",
       "turns out, to West Virginia and to Delaware, and frankly, to \n",
       "all the other 48 States across the country. I want to commend \n",
       "the President; I want to commend Administrator Regan, Assistant \n",
       "Administrator Fox, and all of EPA for proposing a thoughtful, \n",
       "science based, national drinking water standard for PFAS.\n",
       "    This critical step to protecting our drinking water comes \n",
       "on top of the President calling for significant investments to \n",
       "protect our public health and environment in his proposed 2024 \n",
       "budget released last week. In his budget, the President \n",
       "requested more than $12 billion for EPA, $1.9 billion, a 19 \n",
       "percent increase from the 2023 enacted level. More than $4 \n",
       "billion of that proposal is reserved for water infrastructure. \n",
       "That includes an additional $219 million for grants to reduce \n",
       "the amount of lead in drinking water, to test for and remove \n",
       "lead in schools, and to replace lead pipes.\n",
       "    This budget builds on the Committee's work in the \n",

       "    As we have discussed, Democrats and Republicans on this \n",

       "years that we actually lived there, my first 6 years of my \n",

       "to catch small fish, sometimes frogs, and we were never allowed \n",
       "to eat any of them. Nor were we allowed to drink the water from \n",

       "people.\n",
       "    So let me give you a brief report out on how implementation \n",
       "is going at the EPA. Congress provided the majority of the \n",
       "water funding through the State Revolving Loan Funds program, \n",
       "the SRFs, about $43 billion. In March 2022, EPA issued our SRF \n",
       "implementation memo. That document established key priorities \n",
       "consistent with the legislation that has really been our north \n",
       "star for how we have been implementing this bill.\n",
       "    The key priorities that we outlined in that SRF \n",
       "implementation memo were, one, to provide flexibility to States \n",
       "in meeting their local water needs, increasing investment in \n",
       "disadvantaged communities, making rapid progress on lead \n",
       "service line replacements, addressing PFAS and other emerging \n",
       "contaminants, advancing climate adaptation and mitigation, and \n",
       "supporting good jobs here in America.\n",
       "    We engaged very closely with the States as we developed \n",
       "this implementation memo. We have a State SRF work group. And \n",
       "that has really set the foundation for a robust partnership \n",
       "with the States in implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure \n",
       "Law.\n",
       "    So here we are about 1 year later, and I am delighted to \n",
       "report that 47 States and six Tribes and territories have \n",
       "received nearly $5 billion in SRF funding in the first year. \n",
       "That is a big number, and I want to talk for a minute about \n",
       "what that means for people and for local communities.\n",
       "    For example, because of these investments, Sierra Vista RV \n",
       "Park in Arizona will be able to remove arsenic and nitrates \n",
       "from their drinking water. Local government leaders in Sussex \n",
       "County, Delaware, will be able to connect hundreds of homes to \n",
       "a regional water system, which will also protect nearby marshes \n",
       "along the Delaware Bay. And in Pittsburgh, we are going to \n",
       "remove nearly 1,000 lead pipes in low income and working class \n",
       "neighborhoods.\n",
       "    Those are just a couple of examples of the thousands of \n",
       "projects that are going to be funded by the SRFs. That is the \n",
       "real deal that we are delivering to America because of the \n",
       "Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n",
       "    Let me touch on a couple of other highlights. The \n",
       "Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also established the Emerging \n",
       "Contaminants and Smaller Disadvantaged Communities Grant \n",
       "Program. Just a few weeks ago, we announced the first $2 \n",
       "billion funding available through that on a non-competitive \n",
       "basis available to all the States that want those resources. \n",
       "Very excited about that.\n",
       "    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is also investing nearly \n",
       "$2 billion through the agency's Geographic National Estuary and \n",
       "Gulf Hypoxia programs. These investments are so wonderful. They \n",
       "are supporting conservation, restoration, infrastructure \n",
       "programs to protect some of our nation's most treasured waters, \n",
       "the Chesapeake Bay, the Great Lakes, the Mississippi River \n",
       "Basin, the Gulf of Mexico, the San Francisco Bay, really just \n",
       "quite remarkable.\n",
       "    We are also working, because of the Bipartisan \n",
       "Infrastructure Law, to ensure that our groundwater is safe. We \n",
       "are providing $50 million to help States develop and implement \n",
       "underground injection control classics program to support \n",
       "carbon capture and sequestration. We have a letter of inquiry \n",
       "on that process underway, where States can seek these resources \n",
       "if they want primacy of the program. We are going to be \n",
       "awarding funds to States by the end of this year.\n",
       "    I want to conclude my remarks by emphasizing something that \n",
       "both you, Senator Capito, and Senator Carper said, and that is \n",
       "that we are really dedicated to ensuring that all communities \n",
       "benefit from this investment. We know there are too many small \n",
       "communities, too many rural communities, too many underserved \n",
       "urban distressed areas that have not received their fair share \n",
       "of Federal funding. We can and we must do better. That is our \n",
       "focus at EPA.\n",
       "    In addition to all of the work to get these resources out \n",
       "to States and local communities, we have been standing up the \n",
       "most significant technical assistance program, because we think \n",
       "that is what will change the odds for communities who haven't \n",
       "been able to get their fair share. We are actively working in \n",
       "communities across the country from McDowell County, West \n",
       "Virginia, to Lowndes County, Alabama, to communities all across \n",
       "the country. We have 29 environmental finance centers who are \n",
       "providing free technical assistance to communities that want \n",
       "it. We have our Closing the Wastewater Access Gap initiative, \n",
       "we have our Lead Service Line Accelerators.\n",
       "    All of these technical assistance programs are helping \n",
       "build that local community capacity to make sure we are \n",
       "unlocking these resources for every community, so that every \n",
       "community has clean and safe water.\n",
       "    Let me end where I began, which is to say thank you. Thank \n",
       "you so much for the opportunity to steward these resources. It \n",
       "is because of Congress and President Biden that you have \n",

       "    The science on PFAS is clear. Exposure, even at very low \n",
       "levels, is very harmful to human health. What we also know \n",
       "about the science is that people are exposed to PFAS from a \n",
       "variety of means, from their air, their land, and their water. \n",
       "But when PFAS is in drinking water, we know it is one of the \n",

       "science is evolving rapidly as it relates to PFAS. It is \n",
       "grounded in the latest peer reviewed science. It also learned \n",
       "from the dozen States that already have established MCLs for \n",
       "PFAS in drinking water.\n",
       "    As you said, Senator, the proposal calls for regulating six \n",
       "PFAS. We are proposing to set an MCL, maximum contaminant \n",
       "level, of four parts per trillion for PFOA and PFOS. Four parts \n",
       "per trillion is the level at which we can detected PFAS in our \n",
       "drinking water. We have laboratory capacity to do that.\n",
       "    We also are proposing to regulate four additional PFAS as a \n",
       "mixture. These four PFAS are known to co-occur in drinking \n",
       "water. This is GENX, PFES, PFNX, PFE, an alphabet soup of PFAS. \n",
       "But with those four, we are setting a hazard index for those \n",
       "four PFAS.\n",
       "    Also, some of the other features of the rule proposal that \n",
       "we are very pleased with is the public notification \n",
       "requirements, which is so important, so that the American \n",
       "people can know. We have developed a flexible approach to \n",
       "monitoring and compliance, recognizing that water systems are \n",
       "in different places.\n",

       "health and the drinking water standards? I am going to submit \n",
       "questions to you in writing, because this is going to get a \n",
       "little bit technical, and I don't want to take up all my time \n",
       "on technicalities. So if you could respond to those when I send \n",

       "the drinking level, we are going to probably have requirements \n",
       "for systems to test to this level and compliance. There is \n",

       "receivers, somebody who, basically a water system who receives \n",
       "the water from a source and passes the water on, and maybe the \n",

       "issues. I know you are not in charge of CERCLA, but have you \n",
       "all thought about this and what kinds of issues we might be \n",
       "addressing here at the Congress in terms of the passive \n",

       "particularly exciting about how we are approaching the issue of \n",
       "PFAS at the agency is we really are taking a whole of agency \n",

       "very clear in our implementation memo around the Bipartisan \n",
       "Infrastructure Law that we value the flexibility that States \n",
       "have always had with the SRS. Senator Capito, if you look at \n",
       "the thousands of projects that are on these intended use plans, \n",
       "they are so diverse. They are funding drinking water, \n",
       "wastewater, stormwater, small projects, big projects, \n",
       "cybersecurity.\n",
       "    The States are very much in the driver's seat in selecting \n",
       "the projects that really meet the needs of their residents. I \n",
       "think we have preserved that.\n",
       "    It is also a partnership. It is our obligation for \n",
       "oversight and to make sure that States are utilizing various \n",
       "resources in a way that is consistent with the legislation and \n",
       "the statute. An example of that is around disadvantaged \n",
       "communities.\n",
       "    One of the things that we talked about in the SRF \n",
       "implementation memo is, we summarize that of course, States are \n",
       "the ones that determine definition of disadvantaged \n",
       "communities, both on the Clean Water SRF side as well as the \n",
       "Drinking Water SRF side. To be helpful, in that implementation \n",
       "memo we laid out criteria that tend to be good criteria that \n",
       "States are utilizing in those definitions, and then ones that \n",
       "may be more problematic. And what is so exciting is that a \n",
       "number of States sort of chose to amend their definition of \n",
       "disadvantaged communities. So we are seeing this trend line of \n",
       "those definitions really being consistent with the statute, the \n",

       "    Senator Capito. I appreciate that answer. I think part of \n",
       "your answer went to what my opening statement was saying, that \n",
       "the States need to be in the driver's seat, the States are \n",
       "going to be able to make the best determinations. I think what \n",
       "we have seen, not just at EPA but also over at Transportation, \n",
       "is the Administration is putting the foot on the pedal here in \n",
       "certain instances, and suggesting certain parameters that then \n",
       "lead to our States wondering if we don't go the way that EPA is \n",

       "say penalty, but are we being guided by other issues that \n",
       "really, if we were doing it on our own, we wouldn't be doing it \n",

       "stakeholders, constituents and others, who are concerned that \n",

       "    But also concerning was the rule's shift in applying the \n",
       "burden of proof. This is a very specific issue, the burden of \n",
       "proof on the landowners for proving that their land is non-\n",
       "jurisdictional, so on these jurisdictional questions. Can you \n",
       "explain why it does that? The previous rule, the Trump rule in \n",
       "its preamble states emphatically that the burden of proof is \n",

       "both in my confirmation hearing, and Administrator Regan, when \n",
       "he had his confirmation hearing, we both talked about how our \n",
       "priority was to stop the ping-pong with Waters of the United \n",
       "States, and to put forward a balanced rule that provided clear \n",
       "rules of the road to farmers, to ranchers, to landowners, to \n",
       "developers. And we have done that.\n",
       "    Our rule is not the Obama Clean Water Rule. It is a much \n",
       "more narrow definition of Waters of the United States than the \n",
       "Obama Rule. It is not the Trump Navigable Waters Rule either, \n",
       "which as you know was vacated by multiple courts, and it was \n",
       "off the books as of August 2021.\n",
       "    One of the things that we really focused on in the \n",
       "development of our rule was practical implementation \n",
       "considerations. That is what I heard when I was in North \n",
       "Dakota. And on this landowner question, a couple of things that \n",
       "I would share. One is that as part of our 2023 rule, we have a \n",
       "whole landowners guide that makes it very easy for landowners \n",
       "to understand what is, if a permit might be needed or not.\n",
       "    We also have worked closely with Army Corps where they can \n",
       "provide free jurisdictional determinations to any landowner \n",
       "that asks for them and to do that quickly. So that is a key \n",
       "feature.\n",
       "    One of the things I am most proud about as far as our 2020 \n",
       "rule is we also clarified what is out. So in the rule, we \n",
       "codified eight exclusions that we heard in places like North \n",
       "Dakota are very important, for example, with prior converted \n",
       "cropland. This is something that so many farmers and ranchers \n",
       "have said, it is confusing.\n",
       "    So in the rule, we have made that a categorical exemption, \n",
       "very clear. And w We partnered very closely with USDA on that \n",
       "because we thought it was also really important that our \n",
       "definitions between the different agencies are aligned. That is \n",
       "why USDA is so supportive of this particular rule.\n",
       "    Finally, again, the focus on implementation versus fighting \n",
       "about the definition at the Federal level is really a priority \n",
       "moving forward. One thing that we did is, as we issued our \n",
       "final rule, we also issued a series of implementation \n",
       "memoranda. Some of them are between EPA and Army, where we are \n",
       "doing trainings to make sure that there is a consistent \n",
       "understanding of this definition.\n",
       "    We also have a coordination, an MOU with USDA, again on how \n",
       "do we make sure some of these programs are aligned for the \n",
       "agriculture community.\n",
       "    Senator, I believe we have delivered on what we said we \n",
       "would do. No more ping-pong, let's find the center, let's give \n",
       "people clear rules of the road as it relates to Waters of the \n",
       "United States. Then also to make sure we are protecting those \n",
       "vital water resources. I hope you see that we have struck that \n",

       "of things. One is, one of the most exciting features of the \n",
       "Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is that you all provided about 49 \n",
       "percent of resources must be spent for, be put out as grants \n",
       "and principal forgiveness in disadvantaged communities. I think \n",
       "your vision in designing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has \n",
       "unlocked so much potential.\n",
       "    The challenge, Senator, is that disadvantaged communities \n",
       "often don't have the financial capacity to access the loan \n",
       "aspect of the SRFs. So by putting so much money out as grants \n",
       "and principal forgiveness, you have removed one of the critical \n",
       "barriers that these communities face.\n",
       "    But we know that just having the resources available isn't \n",
       "enough. That is why we have stood up the ambitious technical \n",
       "assistance program alongside the capital projects that we are \n",
       "funding. We have built out our environmental finance centers; \n",
       "we have 29 of them. Every region, EPA region, has an \n",
       "environmental finance center as well as national ones. They are \n",
       "basically available to any community that wants technical \n",
       "assistance in order to access the SRF funds.\n",
       "    As we design that technical assistance effort, I thought \n",
       "about when I worked at a local water utility, I was at the San \n",
       "Francisco Public Utilities Commission, and there we had access \n",
       "to all of the best engineering, design, financial planning. A \n",
       "disadvantaged community doesn't have access to those things, \n",
       "but they need that in order to get these SRF funds.\n",
       "    So we are basically making that available to any community \n",
       "that wants them. We just opened up our TA web page, so I would \n",
       "love to share that information with the Committee so that you \n",
       "can share it with your constituents.\n",
       "    We are going to be helping thousands of communities access \n",
       "these SRF dollars. Really, that is the core of the strategy, \n",
       "providing that technical assistance support, so that these \n",
       "disadvantaged communities can build their technical, financial, \n",
       "and managerial capacity.\n",
       "    Senator Cardin. I want to follow up with you as to how that \n",
       "is being implemented. We have jurisdictions like Baltimore City \n",
       "where the ratepayer support is just inadequate to deal with the \n",
       "needs that we have, because of income. Then we have communities \n",
       "like Smith Island, which are so isolated that they just don't \n",
       "have the population to be able to support the water that they \n",
       "need without greater assistance.\n",
       "    So we have different needs in our State. I am sure that is \n",
       "true throughout the country. Technical assistance would be \n",
       "critically important. But also making sure the resources get to \n",
       "those communities. Please keep us informed, and I will be \n",
       "working with you on that.\n",
       "    I want to ask you one other question about the low income \n",
       "water assistance program. We provided $3 million in the fiscal \n",
       "year 2023 omnibus for you to conduct a low income water \n",
       "assistance needs assessment. Senator Wicker and I have worked \n",
       "on the realities that water bills are beyond the capacity of \n",
       "many ratepayers today. We have a low income utility assistance \n",
       "program under LIHEAP, but we think there is a need for one \n",
       "under water. How are you implementing that needs assessment?\n",
       "    Ms. Fox. Thank you for that question, and you are \n",
       "absolutely right. This issue of water affordability, even \n",
       "though the $50 billion in funding from the Federal Government \n",
       "will make a huge difference, water affordability is a growing \n",
       "challenge in communities across the country. In my former role \n",
       "as CEO for the U.S. Water Alliance, I helped create this water \n",
       "equity and affordability network.\n",
       "    As to the assessment, we are currently, we are going to \n",
       "partner with HHS in the development of that assessment, since \n",
       "they are managing the LIWAP program. We are currently designing \n",
       "the methodology for that assessment, and it is going to get \n",
       "underway very soon. And I am happy to keep your office, Senator \n",
       "Cardin, and Senator Wicker's offices up to date on how that \n",
       "assessment is going.\n",
       "    In addition to that, we are working closely to support HHS \n",
       "as they continue to administer the LIWAP program, which we are \n",
       "so grateful was developed by this Congress.\n",

       "rule by EPA and the Army Corps on the definition of Waters of \n",
       "the United States. As you know, there has been a push by some \n",
       "in Congress to use the Congressional Review Act, a CRA, to \n",
       "repeal this rule. You and I discussed some of my concerns here, \n",

       "implementation questions.\n",
       "    But I want to talk for a minute about what would happen if \n",
       "the CRA passed. We are going to have a vote on it. So if it \n",
       "passed, I want to start with a few yes/no questions.\n",
       "    So if the 2023 WOTUS rule were repealed, would the Trump \n",
       "era Navigable Waters Protection rule take effect?\n",
       "    Ms. Fox. No, it would not. Because it was vacated in August \n",
       "2021, by a Federal court.\n",
       "    Senator Kelly. And would the 2025 Obama era WOTUS rule take \n",
       "effect?\n",
       "    Ms. Fox. No, it would not.\n",
       "    Senator Kelly. So my understanding is the rule that would \n",
       "be in effect would be something similar to the pre-2015 WOTUS \n",
       "guidance, is that correct?\n",
       "    Ms. Fox. That is correct, Senator.\n",
       "    Senator Kelly. And that guidance, my understanding is that \n",
       "it relies on the same types of significant nexus test as the \n",
       "WOTUS rule that EPA and the Army Corps finalized this January, \n",
       "is that right?\n",
       "    Ms. Fox. Yes, but there are key differences in how we \n",
       "approach it.\n",
       "    Senator Kelly. Can you explain those differences?\n",
       "    Ms. Fox. Yes, sir. The CRA, if it were to pass, it would as \n",
       "you said put us back to the pre-2015 definition of Waters of \n",
       "the United States. That definition is broader than our 2023 \n",
       "rule; our 2023 rule is more narrow in the definition of Waters \n",
       "of the United States. It is more uncertain. So there would be \n",
       "key challenges.\n",
       "    With a CRA, you can't sort of take parts of the rule that \n",
       "work and parts that don't that people might have concerns \n",
       "about. It wipes out the entire rule and puts back in place the \n",
       "2015.\n",
       "    So we would, for example, on the question of the two test \n",
       "significant nexus, and relatively permanent, in our 2023 rule, \n",
       "significant nexus is much more narrowly defined than in 2015. \n",
       "And it would be utilized only in a very small number of waters, \n",
       "whereas it would be much more broad in the 2015 versus the \n",
       "2023.\n",
       "    Another challenge if the CRA would pass is that many of the \n",
       "exemptions and exclusions that I was talking to Senator Cramer \n",
       "about just a moment ago, those would all be voided out. And \n",
       "because the CRA says that agencies cannot ever adopt a rule \n",
       "that is similar in the future, we may never be able to ever \n",
       "bring back things like prior converted crop or exemptions for \n",
       "artificial ponds, things like that. So it would really create \n",
       "confusion, uncertainty, and void the very common sense aspects \n",
       "of the rule that we worked so hard to put in place.\n",
       "    Senator Kelly. So the things we did in the 2023 rule, that \n",
       "actually made it narrower?\n",
       "    Ms. Fox. Yes.\n",
       "    Senator Kelly. If we go back to the 2015, and we do it \n",
       "through the CRA process, in the future we couldn't use those \n",
       "same items as you just addressed to get a narrower definition \n",
       "of Waters of the United States?\n",
       "    Ms. Fox. That is correct. Agencies are prevented from \n",
       "issuing anything that is similar.\n",
       "    Senator Kelly. So this took us a while to sort through. It \n",
       "is not an obvious thing, how sometimes you can, through a CRA \n",
       "process, you are trying to get an outcome that might be \n",
       "narrower, and in fact you have some unintended consequences. \n",
       "And I think that is the case here. Is that your sense?\n",
       "    Ms. Fox. That is absolutely the case. We would be throwing \n",
       "out a narrower definition of Waters of the United States. We \n",
       "would be throwing out all of the implementation direction that \n",
       "we provided. We would be throwing out the collaboration memos \n",
       "between USDA and EPA and Army Corps that will help with good \n",
       "implementation. We would be going back to a broader definition \n",
       "of significant nexus.\n",
       "    It would create a great deal of uncertainty in communities \n",
       "across the country. We believe it would lead to delays in \n",
       "permitting important projects, permitting infrastructure \n",
       "projects, developing happening on land. And so it is not the \n",
       "right tool.\n",
       "    We can always improve on Waters of the United States. We \n",
       "welcome that conversation with this Committee. We are also \n",
       "laser sharp focused on doing implementation work in a way that \n",
       "addresses the regional differences across the country. We would \n",
       "lose all of that if this rule gets CRAd.\n",

       "as Senator Cardin said, not just for big cities but also \n",
       "especially in Nebraska, small, rural communities. Obviously, \n",
       "the EPA has, on Tuesday, released its first national standard \n",
       "for six PFAS levels for drinking water. Small water systems, \n",
       "again, often don't have the technical capability for dealing \n",
       "with these and implementing these sorts of monitoring \n",
       "requirements.\n",
       "    How do you plan to assist small water systems, especially \n",
       "in rural areas, for doing the testing and compliance for being \n",
       "able to comply with this rulemaking?\n",
       "    Ms. Fox. Thank you for that question. This is a huge \n",
       "priority for us in the Office of Water, how do we broadly make \n",
       "sure that smaller water systems, rural systems benefit broadly \n",
       "from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and everything that we \n",
       "are doing on this question of PFAS specifically.\n",
       "    There are a couple of things. One is that we have recently \n",
       "started our UCMR 5, which is an ongoing monitoring program. \n",
       "Historically, larger water systems do that. It is harder for \n",
       "smaller systems. We advocated for resources so that smaller \n",
       "systems could do that. Because of the generosity of Congress, \n",
       "we have resources now to work with smaller systems on that.\n",
       "    In the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, there is a new $5 \n",
       "billion grant program that is dedicated to small systems and \n",
       "disadvantaged communities to basically look at issues of PFAS \n",
       "and other emerging contaminants. So that is going to be \n",
       "resources that are dedicated to the very communities that you \n",
       "are asking about, Senator. Those resources can help other grant \n",
       "programs, so you don't have to pay anything back. They can use \n",
       "that for testing, for remediation, implementing treatment \n",
       "technologies. So that is going to make a huge difference.\n",
       "    What we have learned in our work across rural America is \n",
       "that just getting resources, making resources available isn't \n",
       "enough. You have got to support smaller systems, rural systems, \n",
       "in building their technical, financial, and managerial capacity \n",
       "to be able to both get that grant or get that loan, and then be \n",
       "able to implement it well.\n",
       "    That is why we are spending so much time building out the \n",
       "technical assistance infrastructure. We have 29 environmental \n",

       "time here, so I am just going to talk about another thing we \n",

       "communities. The intent of these funds was to help communities \n",
       "that need the most to be able to get the resources. My \n",
       "understanding, though, is that some communities feel like there \n",
       "have been other priorities put in there with regard to climate \n",
       "rather than safe drinking water.\n",
       "    Is that something you feel is being pushed in the \n",
       "legislation? That was not Congress's intent. Or do you feel \n",
       "people are just taking this the wrong way? What is your \n",
       "response when you hear some of those criticisms?\n",
       "    Ms. Fox. I do think it is a misunderstanding, Senator. We \n",
       "have been very clear in our implementation memo and in all of \n",
       "our discussions that the States are in the driver's seat in \n",
       "making decisions around the SRF program. Because they know what \n",
       "communities need those resources the most.\n",
       "    So we have been clear on that. We certainly encourage \n",
       "climate considerations. But it is not a requirement. Certainly \n",
       "in places like Oklahoma, drought is a top concern. So, \n",
       "certainly projects that are going to help water supply \n",
       "diversification and conservation ground water re-use and \n",
       "recharge, these are things that are going to really matter in \n",
       "communities.\n",
       "    But no, the States are in the driver's seat as far as \n",
       "selecting projects.\n",
       "    Senator Ricketts. Great. Thank you very much.\n",
       "    Ms. Fox. Thank you.\n",
       "    Senator Carper. Senator Ricketts, thanks for joining us.\n",
       "    Senator Sullivan, good morning. Welcome.\n",
       "    Senator Sullivan. Ms. Fox, I want to start with a chart \n",
       "here that I have trotted out a lot in this committee room. This \n",
       "is a chart of life expectancy in America and in Alaska in \n",
       "particular for the last 25 years, from 1980 to 2014. Do you see \n",
       "where the blue and dark blue is? That is life expectancy going \n",
       "up a lot. Actually yellow, orange, red, actually life \n",
       "expectancy has decreased, that is really sad in America. Mostly \n",
       "that has been due to the opioid epidemic that has killed so \n",
       "many Americans.\n",
       "    But my State, particularly in the rural regions, the North \n",
       "Slope, interior, Aleutian Island chain, has had the largest \n",
       "life expectancy increases of any place in the country in the \n",
       "last 25 years, up to 13 years in many of our rural areas. So \n",
       "that is a great indicator of policy success.\n",
       "    Why do you think that happened? That is a hard question. \n",
       "But 1980 to 2014, what else happened in Alaska during that \n",
       "time? I will just answer. It is not an easy question.\n",
       "    So we had a very big boom in resource development, oil and \n",
       "gas, mining. So when I get upset about these issues, when \n",
       "Federal agencies try to shut down resource development in my \n",
       "State, it is literally a matter of life and death. The \n",
       "communities in rural Alaska that have benefited from that, they \n",
       "are living longer. And I don't know if there is any policy \n",
       "indicator of success more important than are the people you \n",
       "representing living longer.\n",
       "    Would you agree with me?\n",
       "    Ms. Fox. Yes.\n",
       "    Senator Sullivan. Anything more important than that?\n",
       "    Ms. Fox. No.\n",
       "    Senator Sullivan. No, I don't think so, either.\n",
       "    So one of the things that is frustrating, we just went \n",
       "through this Willow process, the vast, vast majority of the \n",
       "Alaska Native people were supportive. The national media hated \n",
       "to write that story. They kept canceling the voices of the \n",
       "indigenous people of Alaska. But we finally got it out there.\n",
       "    And one of the big reasons is because of this. They know it \n",
       "is jobs, pride, things that most communities take for granted \n",
       "like running water, flush toilets. You get infrastructure, you \n",
       "get jobs, you get revenues, you can do those things that, in \n",
       "parts of my State, people haven't had access to for a long \n",
       "time, maybe ever.\n",
       "    So let me talk about a related area. But it is all in this \n",
       "area, too, it is mining. Unfortunately, the Administration on a \n",
       "number of mining projects, the Ambler mining district in \n",
       "particular, we did a 7 year EIS, $10 million. The same day the \n",
       "President held a critical mineral summit at the White House on \n",
       "the importance of cutting our dependence on foreign critical \n",
       "minerals like from China. They reversed that EIS in Alaska.\n",
       "    Now, that was the Department of Interior, Secretary Haaland \n",
       "seems hell bent on reversing everything, despite that chart. \n",
       "Kind of remarkable that she would be doing that. But the EPA \n",
       "recently finalized this 404(c) action on Pebble, the preemptive \n",
       "veto action, but you said, ``It is also important to note that \n",
       "the EPA's action does not apply to current or future resource \n",
       "development projects in Alaska.'' Similarly, Administrator \n",
       "Regan said, ``By no means is this decision meant to send any \n",
       "signals beyond this specific project.''\n",
       "    Can you begin by recommitting to me that EPA won't use \n",
       "404(c) as a precedent to stop future Alaska projects, or \n",
       "importantly, anything that has already previously been \n",
       "permitted in Alaska? Keeping this in mind. Because when you do \n",
       "that, when Deb Haaland recently reversed the Ambler decision, \n",
       "she actually yesterday reversed the King Cove Road decision, \n",
       "there is no Native project that people in Alaska care about \n",
       "that she doesn't reverse, the Native people, by the way, again, \n",
       "stunning to me. But can you recommit to what you and the \n",
       "Administrator already said with regard to mining projects in my \n",
       "State?\n",
       "    Ms. Fox. Yes, and Senator Sullivan, it is good to see you \n",
       "again. I was just thinking, seeing your map, the last time we \n",
       "were together was at the Bethel Airport, this past summer when \n",
       "we were both visiting an Alaska Native village that was working \n",
       "on a water infrastructure project. So it is good to see you \n",
       "again.\n",
       "    And yes, to be clear, EPA has sparingly used our 404(c) \n",
       "authority, only three times in the last 30 years, three times. \n",
       "That is it. And yes, I commit, as does Administrator Regan, \n",
       "that it will be sparingly used. We were very clear that that \n",
       "404(c) action was about a particular mine and a particular \n",
       "geography, the geography of Bristol Bay, a beautiful and unique \n",
       "ecosystem.\n",
       "    Senator Sullivan. OK, thank you, I don't want to interrupt. \n",
       "I just have one final question. I spoke at the annual \n",
       "conference of the Tanana Chiefs Conference yesterday in \n",
       "interior Alaska. I talked about water and sewer and the needs \n",
       "to get some of the communities, we have 30 communities in \n",
       "Alaska that don't have flush toilets and running water.\n",
       "    By the way, these are some of the most patriotic \n",
       "communities in America, because Alaska Natives serve at higher \n",
       "rates in the military than any other ethnic group in the \n",
       "country.\n",
       "    So can you recommit to me, given the resources in the \n",
       "Infrastructure Bill, I told them that you are going to be \n",
       "working with us on getting rid of what we call honey buckets, \n",
       "which is a euphemism for people having to go to the bathroom \n",
       "and then take their own waste out and throw it in a lagoon. \n",
       "Pretty disgusting. American citizens still do that in my State.\n",
       "    Can you recommit to me to help us get rid of the honey \n",
       "bucket once and for all?\n",
       "    Ms. Fox. Absolutely. Seeing first hand people living with \n",
       "honey buckets with washeterias when I visited Alaska last \n",
       "August, I am absolutely committed to this. And I think we have \n",
       "the ability to make tremendous progress because of the \n",
       "Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the incredible leadership \n",
       "that President Biden and this Congress have made in investing \n",
       "$50 billion. So you have my absolute commitment on that.\n",
       "    Senator Sullivan. Great. Thank you.\n",
       "    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n",
       "    Senator Carper. Thank you, Senator.\n",
       "    In the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Ms. Fox, Congress \n",
       "committed to ensuring that disadvantaged communities benefit \n",
       "from Federal drinking water and wastewater infrastructure \n",
       "investments. The Biden administration has made the same pledge \n",
       "through its Justice 40 initiative.\n",
       "    State policies such as project ranking systems that have \n",
       "additional eligibility criteria can create barriers to \n",
       "disadvantaged and underserved communities' ability to access \n",
       "funds. Here is my question: Is EPA tracking these State level \n",
       "barriers, and what is the agency's plan to help communities \n",
       "overcome these barriers so that they can access Federal \n",
       "investment in water infrastructure?\n",
       "    Ms. Fox. Thank you for that question. Yes, Senator, we are \n",
       "tracking those barriers and working actively with individual \n",
       "States as well as with CIFA, the Council of Infrastructure \n",
       "Financing Authorities, to collaboratively develop solutions to \n",
       "those barriers.\n",
       "    The States and EPA, we share a commitment to making sure \n",
       "that we make these resources available to as many communities \n",
       "as possible. And things like a project ranking system, it is a \n",
       "barrier in some States. There are other barriers that exist as \n",
       "well. Some States, for example, have only an annual application \n",
       "process, while other States allow for multiple rounds of \n",
       "submission of SRFs. That is another thing.\n",
       "    I think there are challenges around local communities \n",
       "knowing when to apply and having full transparency into that \n",
       "process. So there are a range of barriers, as there are with \n",
       "many funding and financing programs across the Federal \n",
       "Government. So we are very closely partnering with the States \n",
       "to work through those together.\n",
       "    One thing I can also say is there is an incredible amount \n",
       "of peer exchange and learning that is happening right now \n",
       "across States. There are trainings and opportunities for the \n",
       "States to come together to learn from one another. And we want \n",
       "to support and encourage that as much as possible, as well.\n",
       "    Senator Carper. All right, thank you.\n",
       "    One of the Biden administration's priorities has been to \n",
       "replace lead service lines. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law \n",
       "included $15 billion in funding for full lead service line \n",
       "replacements, a lot of money. In the years leading up to the \n",
       "passage of that law, we heard from several States, including my \n",
       "own State of Delaware, that the prevalence of lead service \n",
       "lines was not a significant problem. However, as some of those \n",
       "States started doing lead inventories, it became clear that the \n",
       "presence of lead pipes and the health impacts they cause is \n",
       "more pervasive than a lot of folks expected.\n",
       "    Given this initial skepticism, have the States been able to \n",
       "use funding for lead service line replacements?\n",
       "    Ms. Fox. One of the most exciting aspects of this job and \n",
       "serving in this capacity is to help deliver on President \n",
       "Biden's commitment to get the lead out once and for all. It is \n",
       "just so remarkable, the President's leadership on this issue. \n",
       "And at the EPA, we are using every tool in our tool box to \n",
       "deliver on that.\n",
       "    As it relates to your question, Senator, the reaction is \n",
       "mixed. There are some States that feel that their allocation of \n",
       "lead service line money is insufficient for the need. Others \n",
       "think that the allocation is too much, given how much the need \n",
       "is there. So we are in constant conversation with the States to \n",
       "understand that.\n",
       "    We do have what is called a reallotment process that we can \n",
       "utilize, so that after 2 years, if a State doesn't use their \n",
       "lead service line money, we can reallocate it to a State that \n",
       "could use it. So right now, we are in the process of working \n",
       "with the States to make sure that they know they can use this \n",
       "money to support inventory development. Because that is the \n",
       "first thing to really understand the nature and scope of the \n",
       "problem to start those replacement projects. But then yes, \n",
       "after those 2 years of States utilizing those resources, we \n",
       "will be able to reallocate.\n",
       "    Senator Carper. Thank you. My last question today deals \n",
       "with private wells. My family grew up in West Virginia and \n",
       "largely in Virginia. We always had private wells, and I think a \n",
       "lot of folks around the country still do, and a lot of folks \n",

       "farms in some cases.\n",
       "    The presence of contaminated private well water is becoming \n",
       "a problem nationwide, as you know. In Delaware, we know that \n",
       "are about 173,000 residents depend upon private wells. Most \n",
       "people think we don't have that many people in Delaware, but we \n",
       "do. We have a million people now. There are about 173,000 \n",
       "residents who depend on private wells for their drinking water. \n",
       "This number is actually growing, not shrinking.\n",
       "    Congress included language in the Drinking Water and \n",

       "literally witnessed a terrible tragedy at Moffett Field Naval \n",

       "flew in.\n",
       "    Early one morning, two planes were coming down to land \n",
       "simultaneously on the two parallel runways, a Navy P3 on the \n",
       "right and a larger NASA aircraft on the left. Both planes were \n",
       "cleared to land, as it turned out, on the same runway. And the \n",
       "larger NASA plane crushed the P3 and killed about 18 people. \n",
       "Firefighters rushed out to try to save lives; 18 people died.\n",
       "    About 28 years later, I was living in Delaware heading down \n",
       "Route 1, heading down to the Rehobeth area, approaching Dover \n",
       "Air Force Base, which is on the left as you head south on Route \n",

       "engines. The flight engineer shut down the wrong engine. So \n",
       "instead of having four engines working, they had two. They had \n",
       "a full bag of fuel and fully loaded. And they tried to come \n",
       "around and land on the runway, they lost their altitude, they \n",

       "end of the runway.\n",
       "    Firefighters came out from all over the Dover Air Force \n",
       "Base, covered the plane with foam and saved every life. Saved \n",

       "They are an excellent funding partner with West Virginia. They \n",

       "lead service lines on top of all of that.\n",
       "    So it is a lot for all of these communities to take on. And \n",
       "we are working with them on these one by one. That is why the \n",

       "    For both of you, can you speak to how your systems use \n",
       "smart water technologies to reduce water loss and improve \n",
       "system efficiencies, and how would additional Federal resources \n",
       "such as through the Water Infrastructure Modernization Act help \n",
       "water and wastewater systems further deploy these technologies?\n",
       "    Mr. Hayman. I will gladly take that question, Senator. It \n",
       "is important that as a water utility that we keep evolving. And \n",
       "one of the main things we have to do is use technology to our \n",
       "advantage, and do it in a way that is economically feasible. \n",
       "Affordability is a big issue. But when we are able to use \n",
       "technology in the big picture to develop a system that is \n",
       "responsible to our customers, we are doing what is the right \n",
       "thing to do.\n",
       "    As far as smart technology, we have AMI, the Automated \n",
       "Meter Infrastructure program, where we are able to get real \n",
       "time information about water usage. So you go to the app, go to \n",
       "the website, and look and see, what is my bill. What happens in \n",
       "that situation, instead of having a running pipe, let's say a \n",
       "broken toilet that you are not aware of in the basement, and \n",
       "your bill is going up, you will be able to go to the site, and \n",
       "you will see what your bill is. That information truly is power \n",
       "and allows you to be more economically sensible in how you are \n",
       "handling your household economics.\n",
       "    The bottom line, too, is we also have systems that allow us \n",
       "to hear leaks in pipes. We had a situation where there was a \n",
       "leakage, we couldn't find it. We used the technology, we are \n",
       "working still to pinpoint it, but we are a lot closer than we \n",
       "were before.\n",
       "    So the use of technology is important. And the funding is \n",
       "imperative, because all the things we want to do cost. We are \n",
       "dealing with a situation where rates are getting higher and \n",
       "higher, coming to a level of not being sustainable for many in \n",
       "our communities.\n",

       "the customer and to allow us to keep our rates low or not to \n",

       "resulted in? Any anecdotal example.\n",
       "    Mr. Hayman. I would have to go back and supplement the \n",
       "record after the hearing on that. But I must say that the AMI \n",
       "process, of being able to have real time information, is truly \n",
       "important, and it is revolutionary in Philadelphia. Because \n",
       "what is happening is that people can monitor the water usage, \n",
       "they can monitor if there is a leak in a pipe. It is a $100 \n",
       "million project. But it is going to be greatly beneficial for \n",

       "    Senator Kelly. Mr. Sigmund.\n",
       "    Mr. Sigmund. Coming from a clean water utility, water loss \n",
       "is not a concern for us. But in the implementation of smart \n",
       "technology, in our interceptor systems, we do use some of the \n",
       "smart meter covers to be able to identify, during periods of \n",
       "wet weather events, high flows that we might either reroute \n",
       "flows if that is possible. Because oftentimes rainfall is not \n",
       "uniform across the service area. Or to be able to deploy forces \n",
       "to potentially mitigate some of the problems with high flows.\n",
       "    Within our treatment facilities, we are a huge energy user. \n",
       "So we have used smart technologies to be able to analyze how we \n",
       "use energy and possibly tie it to some of our aeration \n",
       "equipment to maybe slow down some of the aeration equipment \n",
       "when it is not needed to run at quite the full capacity.\n",
       "    The ability to mine this tremendous amount of information \n",
       "that we collect, we collect tons of information, and our staff \n",
       "can only manage so much, we have gone to technologies to be \n",
       "able to predict where we would go, which helps our operators \n",
       "make better decisions.\n",
       "    So the smart technology in wastewater and utilities is \n",
       "being used, and it is being beneficial, and I mentioned with \n",
       "staffing, as we are struggling to continue to find treatment \n",
       "operators, maintenance and electrician technicians, that smart \n",

       "    Do you want to start, Mr. Hayman?\n",
       "    Mr. Hayman. With PFAS, I think a couple of things. One, it \n",
       "is important that we understand what are we looking at, that we \n",
       "understand what the numbers are. We are going to be receiving a \n",
       "lot of new data on PFAS, so it is important that we work \n",
       "closely with the scientists and engineers to see, what does \n",
       "that really mean.\n",
       "    The other part of it is that anything that we do with PFAS, \n",
       "it is going to be an additional cost. It is going to be an \n",
       "additional burden to the ratepayer. So it is imperative that we \n",
       "receive some funding to assist us in making sure that we are \n",
       "not putting upon the ratepayer a burden that they can't carry, \n",
       "or additional bills that they would have to cover.\n",
       "    Basically, though, I would say that we are going to have to \n",
       "work with our engineers to evaluate it, to make sure we have \n",
       "the machinery to do it. I have to say this: I am very proud of \n",
       "Philadelphia. We are often on the cutting edge, and on this \n",
       "issue, we are on the cutting edge of evaluating PFAS. We have \n",
       "been doing that voluntarily for over a year. We have been \n",
       "putting the information that we find on our website.\n",
       "    Also, we have been transparent. I think too that is going \n",
       "to be a major part of being successful as a water utility in \n",
       "this country, that we cannot go back to how we operated in the \n",
       "1950s, 1960s. There is a need to be transparent. We have done \n",
       "that as far as releasing information and keeping the public \n",
       "informed.\n",
       "    We have to make sure we have the machinery we need and \n",
       "equipment we need to analyze it. We have to understand what we \n",

       "releasing information and educating the public on what we have.\n",
       "    Senator Ricketts. Do you have any idea of how much, just \n",
       "ballpark, what it is going to cost to be able to do that?\n",
       "    Mr. Hayman. I don't know. In all honesty, the law just \n",
       "changed, the requirements changed yesterday. It is now four \n",
       "parts per trillion; before it was, in Philadelphia, I think it \n",
       "was about 14 parts per trillion. So we are going to have to \n",
       "evaluate it and make decisions as we go forward.\n",
       "    Senator Ricketts. Thank you.\n",
       "    Mr. Sigmund.\n",
       "    Mr. Sigmund. We are just in the process of starting an \n",
       "evaluation, data collection and evaluation process for PFAS in \n",
       "our system. We are expecting to spend between our utility and \n",
       "working with our significant industrial dischargers who we \n",
       "believe might discharge PFAS probably in the vicinity of \n",
       "$100,000 to $200,000 a year for the testing and the analysis.\n",

       "not easy. The analysis process is not inexpensive. So that is a \n",
       "big part of it.\n",
       "    One thing I wanted to mention, probably the biggest concern \n",
       "for myself as a utility, is CERCLA in terms of PFAS. As the \n",
       "rule is currently written, wastewater utilities, even though \n",
       "the EPA says they do not play to call us as a principal \n",

       "contribution. That is, I think, going to be one of the biggest \n",
       "concerns for utilities, is being brought into that entire \n",

       "    Ms. Emery.\n",
       "    Ms. Emery. I do share some of Mr. Sigmund's concerns on the \n",
       "part of the utilities. In West Virginia, we have spent the last \n",
       "couple years of doing an assessment of all our drinking water \n",
       "sources in the State, just to try to determine where this is \n",
       "located, at least starting with the drinking water utilities. \n",
       "We are doing further analysis, further testing, finished water, \n",
       "trying to find out the source of contamination.\n",
       "    That being said, we are trying to be very strategic on how \n",
       "we address this, where it is located, where it is coming from. \n",
       "So one of the suggestions we would have is allowing more \n",
       "monitoring to be used out of this emerging contaminants \n",
       "funding. It does say that we can use monitoring, but it has to \n",
       "be specifically tied to an upcoming project. But our POTWs are \n",
       "worried about the expense of monitoring on themselves.\n",
       "    So the flexibility to use this funding to do just \n",
       "monitoring and studies, just to figure out the realm of the \n",
